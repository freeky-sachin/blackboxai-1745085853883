# Rescue Agency Project

## Project Overview
The Rescue Agency Project is a web application built using Django, aimed at providing services and tools for managing rescue operations. This project focuses on enhancing the efficiency of rescue missions through effective management of resources and coordination. 

## Installation

   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment:**
